# ðŸ“± Simple Yet Powerful Calculator

Welcome to my mini calculator project! This is a lightweight, user-friendly calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on creating a functional and stylish calculator without using any built-in JavaScript functions like `eval()` or `Math.evaluate()`, which allowed me to build a custom calculation engine.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Custom-built calculation logic** â€” No `eval()` or `Math.evaluate()`
- **Basic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division etc.
- **Responsive design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Simple UI**: Clean, minimalistic layout for easy interaction
